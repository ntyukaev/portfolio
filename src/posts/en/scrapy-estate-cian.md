Example value: **Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/112.0.0.0 Safari/537.36**.

After you set up the environment variables, go to the project folder and run the following command:

```sh
scrapy crawl cian \
-a location=<location string> \
-a minprice=<min price in rubles> \
